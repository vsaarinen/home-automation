# Remote control

A Spark Core (nowadays replaced by the [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/#photon))
is wired to the remote control of a [cheap radio-controlled wall-switch set](http://www.clasohlson.com/fi/Kaukokytkinsarja-3-kpl-Nexa-PE-3/36-4602).
Button presses can be simulated by making HTTP requests to Particle's cloud system.

I can provide schematics if needed.
